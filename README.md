# 🧮 URN Probability Calculator (Java)

## Overview

A simple Java console application that applies **classical probability** to calculate the chances of drawing a red or blue ball from an urn based on user input.

This project demonstrates the connection between **mathematical probability** and **programming logic**, which is fundamental in **AI and data-driven fields**.

---

## Features

* User-defined number of red and blue balls
* Calculates total outcomes (sample space)
* Computes probabilities for each color
* Displays results as percentages

---

## Concept Used

**P(A) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes**

---

## How to Run

Run the `Main` class, enter the number of red and blue balls, and view the probabilities in the console.
